# NodeJsCrypto
<h4>NodeJsCrypto is a webpage / webservice whose main point is to show cryptocurrencies prices on one screen with the user's account. You, as a user, can monitor cryptocurrencies that have been set by default or add your own (configuring all values like the link to the coin on the coinmarketcap, your balance, and button color ^^ previously). The project works locally on port 4000, but all data is added to COOKIES after the first start and keeps there in your browser cache, so it's ok if you like to close all tabs in your browser :) . </h4>

Just a functional and plain web page that can help you monitor cryptocurrency
courses and your account on one screen. In the project, I used NodeJs as a
server/backend part, which I had never done before. Scraping and parsing logic
were done with the [puppeteer library](https://pptr.dev/) with the data from
the [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) website. The frontend works on [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
and VanillaJS :] .
